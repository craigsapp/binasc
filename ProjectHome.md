The binasc command-line program has similar functionality to that of hex editors: it converts binary files into hexadecimal digits in an ASCII file.  By default the output text will contain comment lines showing printable characters represented by the hex bytes.  The binasc program can convert the ASCII hex codes back into a binary file.  In addition
to hex bytes, the program can compile ASCII characters, 4- and 8-byte floating-point numbers as well as 2- , 3- and 4-multibyte integers into binary content.  The program can also generate Variable Length Values from integers for compiling standard MIDI files.  Multi-byte floats and ints can be specified to be little or big endian.
